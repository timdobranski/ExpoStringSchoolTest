This is a project to provide the students of the La Mesa String School with a solution for scheduling and attendance, payment history & verification, practice and progress tracking, and access to other student resources like my instructional book and sheet music library. As the project progresses, this readme will be updated with more info.

-Current state:
  Supabase Auth features are now integrated. Users can choose an open spot on the schedule and sign up as a student or as a parent/guardian on a student's behalf. Sign up requires email confirmation, handled by supabase, and upon completion the user is brought to the user's Home screen. <br><br>

- Still needs/upcoming chores:<br>
  OAuth 2.0 via Google, Apple, Microsoft<br>
  Google Calendar API to allow booking<br>
  MS Outlook API to track student payments<br>
  Build out student view with the above features<br><br>

  Add manual user support to facilitate CRUD operations on various student data like practice time, progress, songs complete, theory learned and mastery level 1-3,     etc
